## 📝 <span id="description">Description</span>

This project started with an idea from <a href="https://github.com/Eonvorax">Eonvorax</a>, a peer from Holberton School. He wanted a simple way to create a landing page without using complicated templates. We worked together to design a basic and user-friendly page for one of his projects, focusing on what's most important.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

I took that idea and created a minimalist landing page template. It's built with just HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, making it straightforward to modify and customize. The design is responsive and looks great on any device. You can easily adjust elements like colors, logo, titles, and text to fit your needs.

Feel free to use this template however you like. Despite being a learner, I think the code is clean and well-organized, making it easy to make changes or add new features in the future.
